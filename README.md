### 2. Select or Upload Schema

*   **Predefined Schema:** Choose a schema from the dropdown list (e.g., `productSchema`, `userSchema`). The validation will use this structure.
*   **Custom Schema:**
    *   Click the "Upload Custom Schema" button.
    *   Select your JSON schema file (`.json`).
    *   The application will use your uploaded schema for validation.

### 3. Validate Data

*   Click the "Validate CSV" button.
*   The validation process runs in the background.
*   A loading indicator will show while processing.

### 4. Review Results

*   Once validation is complete, the "Validation Results" section will appear below the editor.
*   Results are categorized into **Errors** and **Warnings**.
*   Errors are listed first, followed by warnings.
*   Each result shows:
    *   Row Number (in the original CSV)
    *   Error/Warning Message (including the specific problematic value)
    *   Schema Path (`instancePath`) indicating the location of the issue within the data structure.
*   Counts for total errors and warnings are displayed.

*   Click the "Save CSV" button.
*   This will trigger a download of the currently displayed CSV content as a `.csv` file.

### 7. Automatic Re-validation After Save

*   After saving the CSV, the application automatically re-parses the data from the editor and runs the validation again with the selected schema.
*   The results panel will update to reflect the validity of the *saved* data.
