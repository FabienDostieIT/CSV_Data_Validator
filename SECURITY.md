# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to ensuring the security of the CSV Data Validator. Security updates are applied to the **latest released version** on the `main` branch.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >= 1.0.0 (Latest `main`) | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0  | :x:                |

*(**Note:** Based on your `package.json`, the version is `1.0.0`. This table assumes you only actively support the latest code. Adjust this table if you maintain older versions with security patches).*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly. **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities using one of the following methods:

1.  **(Recommended) GitHub Security Advisories:** You can privately report a vulnerability directly through GitHub by navigating to the "Security" tab of the repository (`https://github.com/FabienDostieIT/CSV_Data_Validator/security/advisories/new`). This is the preferred method as it allows for secure communication and tracking.
2.  **(Alternative) Email:** You can email the report directly to `[Your Security Contact Email Address - e.g., security@yourdomain.com or your personal email if appropriate]`. Please use a clear subject line like "Security Vulnerability Report: CSV Data Validator".

**What to Include in Your Report:**

Please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

*   Type of vulnerability (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, dependency vulnerability, improper validation).
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or examples.
*   Potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any suggested mitigation, if known.

**Our Process:**

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **[e.g., 2-3 business days]**.
2.  **Assessment:** We will investigate the report to confirm the vulnerability and assess its severity and impact.
3.  **Communication:** We will maintain communication with you regarding the status of the report and our findings.
4.  **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is confirmed and requires action, we will work on a fix. Security patches will typically be applied to the `develop` branch first and then merged into the `main` branch for release.
5.  **Disclosure:** Once a fix is available, we may coordinate disclosure with you. We typically aim to credit reporters who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities and helping us keep the CSV Data Validator secure.
